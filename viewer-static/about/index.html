<h3>as:Public (very) Early Demo</h3>
    <h2><a href="/">Return Home</a></h2>
<br />
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>as:Public currently uses two components.</p>
    <p>A <b>Collector</b> connects to instance public ("Federated") Streaming API endpoints.
    Mastodon provides this Federated feed for discovery tools, such as this one.
    Mastodon pushes all public statuses to anybody connected to this endpoint. This includes statuses that were sent to it by other instances.
    It does <b>not</b> include statuses that are Unlisted, Followers-Only, or Private/DM.
    The Collector stores these statuses in a portable file, for storage or for use with a Display.
    Because we wait for servers to push data to us, we use virtually zero resources on their end.</p>
    <p>A <b>Display</b> (the backend for this website) allows lookups against the files the Collector produces.
    It is designed to be run on a machine separate from the collector. The Display software exposes an API that any application can use.
    The garbage-tier HTML frontend I've written uses this API.</p>
    <p>A third component is planned that receives information from multiple collectors, and writes them to a database server such as Postgres.</p>
<br />
    <h2>Can I run my own?</h2>
    <p>The source code for all components will be released in the coming weeks.
    The software is lightweight, and can run on any spare computer, project board, or VPS.
    It is recommended that you run the Collector and Display on separate machines, with separate Internet connections.</p>
<br />
    <h2>How do I exclude my posts?</h2>
    <p>Mastodon does not send to Streaming subscribers, any statuses that are in the Unlisted, Followers-Only, or Private/DM scopes. The use of one of these scopes would disqualify a status from indexing.</p>
    <p>To prevent mistakes with software that might not behave like Mastodon, the actual status "object" is checked for its privacy scope.
    This is actually the <i>first</i> thing done with any status that an instance sends to a Collector.</p>
<br />
    <h2>How do I exclude my instance?</h2>
    <p>The Mastodon Streaming API can be disabled by an instance admin.</p>
    <p>While this will prevent the Collector from subscribing to your instance, it will <b>not</b> prevent ingest from other instances.
    Your instance sends a copy of every status to each instance at which the author has at least one follower.
    The Collector will still be able to ingest statuses that it sees from other servers.</p>
